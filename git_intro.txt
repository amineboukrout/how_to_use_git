creating a git repo:
1. create the project directory on the local machine
* you can either use the GUI or terminal --> mkdir folder_name
2. open the project folder in git bash or open git bash anywhere and cd to path{folder_name}
3. initialize the folder as a git repo --> git init
4. use git status to see what files have been added or edited to the git repo
5. add the desired files to be commited to the staging environment by using git add <filename>
6. after git adding the files you want to commit, use the 'git commit' command to commit/add the file/s you added to the staging environment
